# PurchasingCalculator
This was created for CS1073 Introduction to Java class.
This is JavaFX based GUI application that will allow the user to enter
the unit price of an item and the number of items they want to purchase, and
will then calculate the cost of the purchase by providing a breakdown
including the cost before tax (subtotal), the amount of tax, and the total price.
The store is located in New Brunswick so the sales tax will be 15%.
